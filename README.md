# school-game-project
A Primary school has asked you to create a prototype app to allow pupils to log on and then to play a game that allows them to practice their times table.  The game should allow each pupil to enter their chosen times table to test their knowledge, a random number should be generated and then they will be asked to input the answer.  Input Table: 5 Question: 5 x 8 (this number is randomly generated) Pupil will input answer e.g. 16 If this is correct, then pupil will get a Correct message and a graphic of a trophy will appear. If they don't get it correct, then a try again message will appear. An option to view the 5 times table should also be made available. Finally, if the pupil gets the answer correct, add this to a list. The number of correct answers should be displayed. Additional requirements  Minimum Two forms (pages) - Bright colours as audience will be primary school children. The first should have a password protection (user must enter their name and a password). Just a prototype at this stage, so no restriction to number of attempts. The username must be passed and displayed on the second form The second form should make use of buttons, test boxes and labels and will be the actual game. Make sure that it is easy for the pupils to see where they must type in.
